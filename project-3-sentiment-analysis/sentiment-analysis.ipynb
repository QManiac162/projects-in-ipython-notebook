    "## Introduction\n",
    "A “sentiment” is a generally binary opposition in opinions and expresses the feelings in the form of emotions, attitudes, opinions, and so on. It can express many opinions. For instance, “like,” or “dislike,” “good,” or “bad,” “for,” or “against,” along with others.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using machine learning methods and natural language processing, we can extract the personal information of a document and attempt to classify it according to its polarity, such as positive, neutral, or negative, making sentiment analysis instrumental in determining the overall opinion of a defined objective, for instance, a selling item or predicting stock markets for a given company.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is challenging and far from being solved since most languages are highly complex (objectivity, subjectivity, negation, vocabulary, grammar, and others). However, that is what makes it exciting to working on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, sentiment analysis is prevalent in many applications to analyze different circumstances, such as:<br>\n",
    " - How Twitter users’ attitudes may have changed about the elected President since the US election?\n",
    " - Is this client’s email satisfactory or dissatisfactory?\n",
    " - Is this product review positive or negative?\n",
    " - How are people responding to particular news?\n",
    " - A consumer uses these to research products and services before a purchase.\n",
    " - Production companies can use public opinion to define the acceptance of their products and the public demand.\n",
    " - Moviegoers decide whether to watch a movie or not after going through other people’s reviews.\n",
    " - The prediction of election outcomes based on public opinion.\n",
    " - To measure social media performance.\n",
    " - Along with others."

    "# What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "Fundamentally, we can define sentiment analysis as the computational study of opinions, thoughts, evaluations, evaluations, interests, views, emotions, subjectivity, along with others, that are expressed in a text.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves classifying opinions found in text into categories like “positive” or “negative” or “neutral.” Sentiment analysis is also known by different names, such as opinion mining, appraisal extraction, subjectivity analysis, and others.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "“The story of the movie was boring and a waste of time.”<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following terms can be extracted from the sentence above to perform sentiment analysis:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Opinion Owner: Audience<br>\n",
    "Object: Movie<br>\n",
    "Feature: Story<br>\n",
    "Opinion: Boring and a waste of time.<br>\n",
    "Polarity: Negative<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples:<br>\n",
    "“I like my smartwatch but would not recommend it to any of my friends.”<br>\n",
    "“I do not like love. It is a waste of time.”<br>\n",
    "“Titanic is the best movie of all time.”<br>\n",
    "“I am not too fond of sharp, bright-colored clothes.”<br>"

    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*GVCxRwjPQP1u0IVU-Fz40A.png\"><br>\n",
    "There are several types of Sentiment Analysis, such as Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis, Grading sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral), Multilingual sentiment analysis, detection of emotions, along with others.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "most famous are:<br>\n",
    "Subjectivity/objectivity identification.<br>\n",
    "Feature/aspect-based.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subjectivity/objectivity identification\n",
    "In subjectivity or objectivity identification, a given text or sentence is classified into two different classes:<br>\n",
    "Subjectivity: It expresses an opinion that describes people’s feelings towards a specific topic.\n",
    "e.g., The taste of this mango is good.<br>\n",
    "Objective: It expresses the fact. e.g., This mango is yellow.<br>\n",
    "The subjective sentence expresses personal feelings, views, or beliefs. Sentiment analysis works great on a text with a personal connection than on text with only an objective connection.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature/aspect-based\n",
    "Feature or aspect-based sentiment analysis analyzes different features, attributes, or aspects of a product. Its main goal is to recognize the aspect of a given target and the sentiment shown towards each aspect.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "“Today, I purchased a Samsung phone, and my boyfriend purchased an iPhone. We called each other in the evening. The voice of my phone was not clear, but the camera was good. My girlfriend said the sound of her phone was very clear. So, I decided to buy a similar phone because its voice quality is very good. So, I bought an iPhone and returned the Samsung phone to the seller.”<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying aspect extraction to the sentences above:<br>\n",

    "# steps involved in sentiment analysis:\n",
    " - Data collection: \n",
    "      - Public sentiments from consumers expressed on public forums are collected like Twitter, Facebook, and so on.\n",
    "      - Opinions or feelings/behaviors are expressed differently, the context of writing, usage of slang, and short forms.\n",
    " - Data Analysis:<br>The data analysis process has the following steps:<br>\n",
    "      - 1. Text Preparation\n",
    "         - Data is extracted and filtered before doing some analysis.\n",
    "         - Non-textual content and the other content is identified and eliminated if found irrelevant.\n",
    "      - 2. Sentiment Detection\n",
    "         - Each sentence and word is determined very clearly for subjectivity.\n",
    "         - Sentences with subjective information are retained, and the ones that convey objective information are discarded.\n",
    " - Indexing:\n",
    "      - Sentiments can be broadly classified into two groups positive and negative.\n",
    "      - Each subjective sentence is classified into the likes and dislikes of a person.\n",
    " - Delivery\n",
    "      - It is the last stage involved in the process.\n",
    "      - The result is converting unstructured data into meaningful information.\n",

    "# Methods for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Essentially, sentiment analysis finds the emotional polarity in different texts, such as positive, negative, or neutral. There are two different methods to perform sentiment analysis:\n",
    " - Lexicon-based method\n",
    " - Machine Learning method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexicon-based method\n",
    "    Lexicon-based sentiment analysis calculates the sentiment from the semantic orientation of words or phrases present in a text. The lexicon-based method has the following ways to handle sentiment analysis:\n",
    " - Dictionary\n",
    " - Corpus\n",
    " #### Dictionary:\n",
    "    It creates a dictionary of positive and negative words and assigns positive and negative sentiment values to each of the words. Its dictionary of positive and negative values for each of the words can be defined as:<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/828/0*kDx7DuI03TtRYF-R.png\"><br>\n",
    "    Thus, it creates a dictionary-like schema such as:<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*tAelKvCXr_pQI4hH.png\">\n",
    "    Based on the defined dictionary, the algorithm’s job is to look up text to find all well-known words and accurately consolidate their specific results. Sometimes it applies grammatical rules like negation or sentiment modifier.\n",
    "    For instance, applying sentiment analysis to the following sentence by using a Lexicon-based method:\n",
    "        - “I do not love you because you are a terrible guy, but you like me.”\n",
    "    Consequently, it finds the following words based on a Lexicon-based dictionary:\n",
    "    - love: +5\n",
    "    - like: +2\n",
    "    - terrible: -1.5\n",
    "    -overall sentiment=+5+2+(-1.5)=+5.5\n",
    "        Accordingly, this sentiment expresses a positive sentiment.\n",
    "        Dictionary would process in the following ways:\n",
    "        - flat\n",
    "        - with semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning method\n",
    "    The machine learning method is superior to the lexicon-based method, yet it requires annotated data sets. It requires a training dataset that manually recognizes the sentiments, and it is definite to data and domain-oriented values, so it should be prudent at the time of prediction because the algorithm can be easily biased.\n",
    "    If the algorithm has been trained with the data of clothing items and is used to predict food and travel-related sentiments, it will predict poorly. Therefore, sentiment analysis is highly domain-oriented and centric because the model developed for one domain like a movie or restaurant will not work for the other domains like travel, news, education, and others."

    "# Baseline Machine Learning Algorithms for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "    The following machine learning algorithms are used for sentiment analysis:\n",
    "    - Feature extraction.\n",
    "    - Tokenization.\n",
    "    - SVM.\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes.\n",
    "    - MaxEnt.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Feature Extraction\n",
    "    The feature extraction method takes text as input and produces the extracted features in any form like lexico-syntactic or stylistic, syntactic, and discourse-based. Primarily, it identifies those product aspects which are being commented on by customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is a process of splitting up a large body of text into smaller lines or words. It helps in interpreting the meaning of the text by analyzing the sequence of the words.\n",
    "For example:<br>\n",
    "“This movie is really good.”<br>\n",
    "After applying tokenization:\n",
    "[This, movie, is, really, good]<br>\n",

    "Sentiment analysis is fascinating for real-world scenarios. However, it faces many problems and challenges during its implementation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Below are the challenges in the sentiment analysis:\n",
    "    - It is tough if compared with topical classification with a bag of words features performed well.\n",
    "    - In many cases, words or phrases express different meanings in different contexts and domains.\n",
    "    Other challenges of sentiment analysis:\n",
    "    The main challenge in Sentiment analysis is the complexity of the language.\n",
    "    Negation has the primary influence on the contextual polarity of opinion words and texts. Negation phrases such as never, none, nothing, neither, and others can reverse the opinion-words’ polarities.\n",
    "    Puzzled sentences and complex linguistics. e.g., “Admission to the hospital was complicated, but the staff was very nice even though they were swamped.” Therefore, here → (negative → positive → implicitly negative)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These are some problems in sentiment analysis:\n",
    "    - It is challenging to answer a question — which highlights what features to use because it can be words, phrases, or sentences.\n",
    "    - How to interpret features? It can be a bag of words, annotated lexicons, syntactic patterns, or a paragraph structure."
